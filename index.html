                <p>You’ve been working so hard these past to acheive your goal of being a Software Engineer, you’re so close to your goal that it can be frustrating when you don’t get the job.</p> 
                
                <p> You may not be aware at the time but the path you have undertaken is always a challenging one! You never settled for anything easy and this is why it’s always so frustrating because you’re growing! I promise you that you will get there. Sometimes things happen for a reason and that reason we do not yet know but with time it will become clear</p>

                <p>Please take care and be kind to yourself.</p>
                <p class="font-italic">Love, Nancy.</p>
