                <p class="d-inline">It has been 

                    <p class="d-inline" id="countup"></p> since you started learning to code.</p> 

                <p>You have been working so hard these past few months to achieve your goal of being a Software Engineer.</p> 
                
                <p>You may not be completely aware but the path you have undertaken is always a challenging one. You never settled for anything easy and this is why it’s always so frustrating because you’re growing!</p>

                <p>You are so close to your goal and it can get tough trying to balance life with learning, a full-time job & other responsibilities.</p>
                
                <p>It can also be frustrating when you get rejected for a job. Things happen for a reason and that reason you may not yet know but with time it will become clearer.</p>

                <p>Just keep going, I promise you that you will get there. Please take care and be kind to yourself.</p>

                <p class="font-italic pt-3">Love, Nancy.</p>
