                <p class="d-inline">It has been 

                    <p class="d-inline" id="countup"></p> since you started learning to code.

                </p> 

                <p> You have been working so hard these past few months to achieve your goal of being a Software Engineer. </p> 
                
                <p> You may not be completely aware but the path you have undertaken is always a challenging one. You never settle for anything easy & this is why it feels frustrating sometimes because youâ€™re growing! </p>

                <p> You are so close to your goal and even though it gets tough trying to balance life with learning, a full-time job & other responsibilities, keep on going. </p>

                <p> 
                    Remember: No Fear Here. 1 John 4:18 <q style="font-style: italic;">There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear.</q>
               </p>

                   
                <p>Please take care and always be kind to yourself.</p>

                <p class="font-italic pt-3">Love, Nancy.</p>
